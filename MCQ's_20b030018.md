 - Suppose you are working on weather prediction and use a learning algorithm to predict tomorrow's temperature . What kind of problem would that be? 
   - [ x ] Classification
   - [ ] Regression
 - Suppose that you have trained a logistic regression classifier, and it outputs on a new example x a prediction hθ​ (x) = 0.4. This means (check all that apply):
   - [ x ] Our estimate for P(y = 0| x,θ) = 0.6
   - [ x ] Our estimate for P(y = 1| x,θ) = 0.4
   - [ ] Our estimate for P(y = 1| x,θ) = 0.6
   - [ ] Our estimate for P(y = 0| x,θ) = 0.4
 - Which of the following are reasons for using feature scaling?
   - [ x ]  It speeds up gradient descent by making it require fewer iterations to get to a good solution.
   - [ ] It speeds up solving for θ using the normal equation.
   - [ ] It prevents the matrix XTX (used in the normal equation) from being non-invertable (singular/degenerate).
   - [ ] It is necessary to prevent gradient descent from getting stuck in local optima.
 - Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.
   - [ x ] The cost function J(θ) for logistic regression trained with m≥1 examples is always greater than or equal to zero.
   - [ x ] The sigmoid function g(z)=1/1+e^−z is never greater than one (>1).
   - [ ] For logistic regression, sometimes gradient descent will converge to a local minimum (and fail to find the global minimum).
   - [ ] Linear regression always works well for classification if you classify by using a threshold on the prediction made by linear regression.
 - KNN algorithm does more computation on test time rather than train time.
   - [ x ] True
   - [ ] False
 - Which of the following distance metric can not be used in KNN?
   - [ ] Manhattan
   - [ ] Minkowski
   - [ ] Euclidean
   - [ x ] All of them can be used
 - Which of the following machine learning algorithm can be used for imputing missing values of both categorical and continuous variables?
   - [ x ] KNN
   - [ ] Logistic Regression
   - [ ] Linear Regression
 - Suppose, you have given the following data where x and y are the 2 input variables and Class is the dependent variable. You want to predict the class of new data point x=1 and y=1 using eucledian distance in 3-NN. In which class this data point belong to?

   - [ x ] + class
   - [ ] - class
   - [ ] Can't Say
